# ticTacToe
Simple Tic Tac Toe game

A project I took on to help build a foundation for Javascript.
This is the first full project I built on my own.

The CSS was built using Grid, following a YouTube tutorial by Web Dev Simplified

The logic of the game itself was developed by me, reading documentation when
necessary and using Google as a resource when I got stuck.

I found this project to be especially helpful in learning to use functions
in JavaScript. I am happy with how it turned out and hope you enjoy :)
